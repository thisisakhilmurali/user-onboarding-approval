# user-onboarding-approval

Build a secure User Onboarding and Approval Platform where end users self-register and are placed in a PENDING state until an administrator approves or rejects them. The backend must validate input, hash passwords, persist users. An admin UI (React) must allow login, view pending users, and approving/rejecting them; regular users should see personalized status. The entire system must be containerized (Docker) with secrets externalized via environment variables (no hardcoded credentials), support horizontal scaling (stateless backend, queue decoupling), and provide clear separation of concerns between API, workflow processing, and presentation layers.

Ultimate Requirement:

* This application needs to be fully developed using GitHub Copilot
* Technology Stack:
* Front-End: ReactJS
* Backend: .Net/Nodejs/Java/python
* DB: Azure SQL DB
